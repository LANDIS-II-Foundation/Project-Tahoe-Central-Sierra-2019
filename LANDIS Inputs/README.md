# Project-Tahoe-Central-Sierra-2019

This folder includes inputs for the management scenarios using the 90m TAEA 2019 SilviaTerra veg data set.  Scenarios 1- 6 increase the pace and scale of treatment within the TCSI study area, which is reflected by the changing harvest .txt files and the changing rx ignition maps.
